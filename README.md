I am from China, +8TZ. I have 17 years experience of programming. I am looking for any Rust related remote jobs. I have following experiences:

1. Code in C++, Java, Go, Rust
2. Know async paradigm well in different languages, libuv in C++, Netty in Java, Tokio in Rust
3. Read and code in large codebase like <https://www.webrtc.org>, <https://github.com/notedit/media-server-go>, integrated in products
4. Mix different language with C interface, like rust FFI, cgo
5. Some libs ever used: Qt, libuv, webrtc, Netty, Tokio, Spring, redis, dubbo, RocketMq 

I like learning new technologies and challenges. Feel free to contact me.
